# Maze Generator and Solver with A* Algorithm

## 🚀 Introduction
This project generates and solves a maze using the **Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm** for maze generation and the **A* algorithm** for pathfinding. It also includes an animated visualization of the rat traversing the maze, leaving a red trail behind it while a timer tracks the solving process.

## 📌 Features
- **Maze Generation:** Uses DFS to create a perfect maze.
- **Pathfinding:** Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from start to end.
- **Visualization:**
  - Green maze with clear walls and paths.
  - A moving rat icon searching for the exit.
  - Red path showing the solution in real-time.
  - Timer displaying time taken to solve the maze.
  - Animated traversal of the solution path.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/V-Manish-Kumar/Maze_Generator_And_Solver.git
   cd Maze_Generator_And_Solver
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the script**
   ```sh
   python Maze.py
   ```

## 🎮 Usage
- The script will generate a new maze each time you run it.
- The rat will move through the maze, leaving a red trail as it finds the path.
- The timer will count the solving duration in real-time.
- The solution path will be fully visible after execution.
